# RouteFinder

## Overview

Welcome to the Java Route Finder project, a versatile and efficient solution for finding optimal routes between locations. Whether you need to navigate through a city, plan a road trip, or optimize delivery routes, this Java program provides a powerful tool to find the most efficient paths.

## Features

- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Utilize a variety of advanced pathfinding algorithms, such as Dijkstra's, A*, and more, to discover the shortest and quickest routes.

- **Customizable Inputs**: Define your own maps or networks, or import external data to find routes between specific points of interest.

- **Real-Time Navigation**: For navigation apps, integrate real-time location data and dynamic route updates to help users reach their destinations smoothly.

- **Interactive Visualization**: Visualize routes and network data to better understand and analyze the paths discovered by the algorithms.

- **Customizable Constraints**: Add custom constraints or preferences for routes, including avoiding toll roads, favoring scenic routes, or minimizing travel time.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Java Route Finder project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

2. **Import into IDE**:
Import the project into your Java development environment, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

3. **Compile and Run**:
Build and run the project to start finding routes. Be sure to provide your own maps or network data, or utilize the included sample data.

4. **Customize and Integrate**:
Customize the program to your specific requirements or integrate it into your own applications.

5. **View and Analyze Routes**:
Use the interactive visualization to explore discovered routes and assess their suitability.

## Example Usage

Here's a simple example of finding a route between two locations using Java:

```java
RouteFinder routeFinder = new RouteFinder(mapData);
List<Location> path = routeFinder.findShortestPath(startLocation, endLocation);
